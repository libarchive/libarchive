/*
 * Regression test for a size_t wraparound in process_base_block().
 *
 * The size vint of a base block can decode to values close to SIZE_MAX,
 * because read_var_sized() does not bound the decoded value.  Computing
 * hdr_size = raw_hdr_size + hdr_size_len then wraps around to a small
 * number, which passes the 2 MB sanity check.  The reader accepted the
 * block and desynced; on the 22-byte archive below, the unpatched reader
 * consumed the size vint as a whole block and reported ARCHIVE_EOF.
 *
 * The patched reader bounds raw_hdr_size before the addition and rejects
 * the block up front.
