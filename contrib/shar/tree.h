/*-
 * A set of routines for traversing directory trees.
 * Similar in concept to the fts library, but with a few
 * important differences:
 *    * Uses less memory.  In particular, fts stores an entire directory
 *      in memory at a time.  This package only keeps enough subdirectory
 *      information in memory to track the traversal.  Information
 *      about non-directories is discarded as soon as possible.
 *    * Supports very deep logical traversals.  The fts package
 *      uses "non-chdir" approach for logical traversals.  This
 *      package does use a chdir approach for logical traversals
 *      and can therefore handle pathnames much longer than
 *      PATH_MAX.
 *    * Supports deep physical traversals "out of the box."
 *      Due to the memory optimizations above, there's no need to
 *      limit dir names to 32k.
