.Sh NAME
.Nm shar
.Nd create a shell archive of files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl br
.Op Fl o Ar archive-file
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command writes a
.Xr sh 1
shell script which will recreate the file hierarchy specified by the command
line operands.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command is normally used for distributing files by
.Xr ftp 1
or
.Xr mail 1 .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Use an alternative binary format.
Content of files will be uuencoded.
This option should be used to archive binary files correctly.
In this mode also file permissions will be stored to the archive.
uudecode(1) is needed to extract archives created with this option.
.It Fl o Ar archive-file
Redirect output to
.Ar archive-file .
.It Fl r
If
.Ar file
given on command line is a directory the entire subtree will be archived.
Symbolic links given on command line are followed.
Other symbolic links will be archived as such.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a shell archive of the program
.Xr ls 1
and mail it to Rick:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd ls
shar -r . \&| mail -s "ls source" rick
.Ed
.Pp
To recreate the program directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir ls
cd ls
\&...
<delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
\&...
sh archive
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr compress 1 ,
.Xr mail 1 ,
.Xr tar 1 ,
.Xr uuencode 1 ,
.Xr uuencode 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
This is a re-implementation based on the libarchive(3) library.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
command makes no provisions for hard links.
.Pp
Files containing magic characters or files without a newline ('\\n') as the
last character are not handled correctly with the default format.
Use the
.Fl b
option for binary files.
.Pp
It is easy to insert trojan horses into
.Nm
files.
It is strongly recommended that all shell archive files be examined
before running them through
.Xr sh 1 .
Archives produced using this implementation of
.Nm
may be easily examined with the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
egrep -v '^[X#]' shar.file
